                  1. map() : It creates a new array by applying a callback
                  function to each element of the original array. It returns a
                  new array with the same length as the original array, but with
                  each element transformed by the callback function.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. forEach() : It loops through each element of an array and
                  executes a callback function for each element. It doesn't
                  return anything.
                </p>

                <p>
                  3. filter: It creates a new array by filtering out elements
                  from the original array based on a condition specified in the
                  callback function. It returns a new array with only the
                  elements that pass the condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  4. find(): It returns the first element in an array that
                  satisfies a specified condition. It returns the element
                  itself, not an array

                  1. Local Storage: Local storage is a mechanism to store
                  key-value pairs in the user's browser that persists even after
                  the browser is closed. The data is stored in the form of
                  strings and can only be accessed by the website that created
                  it. Local storage has a larger capacity than cookies and is
                  often used to store non-sensitive data like user preferences
                  or application state.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. Session Storage: Session storage is similar to local
                  storage, but the data stored in session storage is only
                  available for the duration of the browser session. When the
                  user closes the browser, the data is deleted. This makes it a
                  good option for storing sensitive data like user login
                  information or shopping cart details.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. Cookies: Cookies are small text files that are stored on
                  the user's computer by a website. Cookies can be accessed by
                  the website that created them as well as any other website
                  that the user visits that is associated with the cookie.
                  Cookies have a limited size, so they are often used to store
                  small amounts of data like user preferences or tracking
                  information.

                  An event loop is a construct that allows a program to handle
                  multiple tasks simultaneously, without having to wait for each
                  one to complete before moving on to the next. It does this by
                  managing a queue of tasks or events, and executing each one in
                  turn as soon as it becomes ready.
                </p>
                <span>an event loop works:</span>
                <p>
                  1. The program adds tasks to the event queue as they arise,
                  along with a callback function that should be executed when
                  the task is completed. 2. The event loop continually checks
                  the queue for the next task. If there is no task available, it
                  enters a "waiting" state, where it will remain until a new
                  task is added to the queue. 3. When a task becomes ready (e.g.
                  a network request completes), the event loop removes the task
                  from the queue and executes its associated callback function.
                  4.The program can continue to add new tasks to the queue at
                  any time, and the event loop will continue to handle them as
                  they become ready.
